txtnorm
=======

Small program to normalize formatting of a text file. This program is
written in C and produces a small single executable file which performs
some basic manipulation on stdin and streams the new text to standard out.

Usage: txtnorm < infile > outfile

* Converts line endings to LF
* Single quotes (â€˜â€™‘’) become '
* Double quotes (â€œâ€“”) become "
* en dash (â€“) becomes -
* em dash (â€”) becomes -
* hyphen (â€) becomes -
* minus sign (âˆ’) becomes -
* Converts hard wrapped paragraphs to long lines

    This programs will also remove paragraph indentation. If a line is
preceded by double newlines, then leading spaces will be removed. This 
will not imact indentation of lines separated by a single newline. For
example, the following should remain untouched:

* List Item
    * Indented list item
